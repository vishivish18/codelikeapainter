               <p>On a sunny morning in August 2010, I started my quest in the computer world, </br>which was my childhood dream. With experience of zero lines of code under my </br> belt, I had no experience of what it feels to see your logic do the magic. Since </br>then  I have been  fortunate to be surrounded by like minded people and getting </br>opportunities to learn and grow. I am not a pro, infact I have just begun, but yes </br>I am having fun. This blog is for sharing my journey through the world of code.</br> And the blog title is dedicated to Late <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pervez.ahmed.140" target="_blank">Dr. Pervez Ahmed</a>, the man who taught us </br>how to code, like a painter. </p>
